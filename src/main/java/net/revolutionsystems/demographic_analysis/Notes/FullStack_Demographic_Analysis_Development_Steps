** Requirement / Motivation:

Create a full stack application to generate the demographic analysis report for the given city of the united states. When a user provides a city and
state name & distance from the city, the application should perform the demographic analysis of the provided city within the given distance and
generate the excel file.


** STEPS to create Full Stack React App

1. Create a springboot application. Build the controller and run the helloWorld REST API endpoint.
2. Create Entity class with city, county, state, lat and long details. This is required to provide the JPA (Java Persistence API) framework support.

    2A. Create an interface (Repository) that extends the JPA<ClassName, DataType of Id>
            public interface Repo_Population extends JpaRepository<Population,Long>

3. Create "application.properties" file within "resources" folder. Provide the database connection string in the configuration file.

    ## SQL Server Database Connectivity

    #spring.datasource.url=jdbc:sqlserver://localhost\\SAGAR_BHATT:1433;database=USPopulation;integratedSecurity=true
    #spring.datasource.username=SAGAR_BHATT\\Freeware Sys

4. Now, run the application. This will generate the table - "Population" (Name of the class OR provided as @Table annotation) in
 the "USPopulation" database of the SQL Server database.

5. Create a REST API endpoint to fetch the city and States from the API.

    5A. Create a SQL Query to fetch all the details (city, county, state, population, lat, long) of the city and state provided.

        public String qry_findByCityAndState = "  SELECT * \n" +
                    "  FROM [USPopulation].[dbo].[Population]\n" +
                    "  WHERE City_Name = :city AND State_Name = :state";

            @Transactional
            @Modifying
            @Query(value = qry_findByCityAndState, nativeQuery = true)
            public List<Map<String,Object>> findByCity_NameAndState_Name(String city, String state);

    5B. The response of the query should be in "List<Map<String,Object>>" form. This is important to convert the response into JSON format.
